        <p class="centeralign">  I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Geographical Information 
        System at the University of Leeds under the UK's Chevening Program. I am interested in geodemographics, the applications 
        of GIS in studying human health and Participatory Geographic Information Systems (PGIS) approaches in community development.
        I have 5 years experience working with QGIS and ArcGIS and a beginner in Python programming. 
        This is the first website I've ever created from scratch!

    <h3 class="centeralign"><b> Python programming - My experience as a beginner </b> </h3>

        As part of my MSC core modules at the University of Leeds, I learned the basics of programming using Python. Learning programming has been very challenging 
        given that I have no background in Information Systems or Programming. However, I have come to understand some of the basics where
        I've learned how to write, debug and run a code for Agent Based Modelling. I have made some adjustments to the original code. The 
        model named - <b> Crazy Yellow Ants Invasion,</b> models the spread of these invasive ants destroying an ecosystem, 
        until the conditions (an increase in temperature) becomes unfavourable and they die. The source code can be found
